Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals.
We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. 
Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands.

## ✨Architecture Overview

GeoThinker represents a paradigm shift in how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand the 3D world, moving from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">passive fusion</span> to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">active perception</span>. GeoThinker empowers the model to selectively query the geometric information it needs to solve a specific task.
1. Dual-Encoder Processing

    The system begins by processing input video frames through two specialized paths. 
    * A 2D vision encoder extracts high-level semantic features (the "what" of the scene). 
    * A 3D visual geometry encoder (VGGT) captures fine-grained spatial structures and inter-frame dependencies (the "where" and "how" of the 3D space).

2. Spatial-Grounded Fusion (SGF)

    Instead of mixing features at the start, GeoThinker uses the Spatial-Grounded Fusion (SGF) module to manage interactions. 
    * SGF employs frame-strict cross-attention, ensuring that visual tokens only look at geometric cues from the corresponding frame to maintain spatial consistency. 
    * An Importance Gating module predicts a localized bias, allowing the model to focus on salient geometric features like object boundaries while ignoring redundant noise like empty floors or walls.

## ⚙️Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker
    cd GeoThinker
    ```

2.  **Create a Conda environment and install dependencies:**
    We recommend using Python 3.10.
    ```bash
    conda create -n geothinker python=3.10
    conda activate geothinker
    pip install -e .
    ```


## 📊Datasets

GeoThinker is trained and evaluated on a variety of datasets:

* **Vanilla Regime:**
    * [SPAR-7M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jasonzhango/SPAR-7M): We used a subset of ~234K samples (3% of original). Data prep follows official codebase, navigation type discarded.
    * [LLaVA-Video-178K (LLaVA-Hound split)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-Video-178K): We used a subset of ~63K samples (25% of original). 
    * Evaluation Benchmarks: We adopt [VSI-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/VSI-Bench) for main evaluation.
* **Scaled Regime:**
    * [SPAR-7M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jasonzhango/SPAR-7M): As mentioned at **Vanilla Regime** above.
    * [LLaVA-Video-178K (LLaVA-Hound split)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-Video-178K): As mentioned at **Vanilla Regime** above.
    * [VLM-3R](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Journey9ni/VLM-3R-DATA): We leverage instruction data of VSI-Bench and VSTI-Bench for fine-tuning. Notably, we excluded ARkitScene annotations to ensure all data align with the corresponding images available in the ScanNet subset of the SPAR-7M dataset.
    * [PhysGame](https://huggingface.co/PhysGame/PhysVLM-SFT): We utilize the PhysVLM-SFT data from the PhysGame dataset. For this specific subset, we sampled 8 frames per video. (Increasing this to 32 frames may further enhance model performance)
    * [VSI-590k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/VSI-590K): We alos utilize the VSI-590k instruction dataset, sourced from Cambrian-S.
    * [Cambrian-s-3M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/Cambrian-S-3M): To enhance general video understanding, we incorporate a 430k subset (approximately 11%) of the Cambrian-S-3M dataset. This diverse mixture includes various sources such as <span><i>ActivityNet, CLEVR, FAVD, GUIWorld, K400, K710, LSMDC, MovieChat, NextQA, ShareGPT4Video, SSV2, STAR, TextVR, TGIF, TimeIT, TVQA, VidLN, WebVid</i>, and <i>YouCook2</i></span>.
    * Evaluation Benchmarks: We adopt [VSI-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/VSI-Bench), [MMSI-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RunsenXu/MMSI-Bench), [MindCube](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MLL-Lab/MindCube), [ViewSpatial](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lidingm/ViewSpatial-Bench), [SITE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/franky-veteran/SITE-Bench), [CV-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-visionx/CV-Bench) and etc. for evaluation.

## Finetuned Models

Our models are built upon two variants of Qwen2.5-VL, [Qwen2.5-VL—3B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct),  [Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) and [Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct), and are integrated with VGGT-1B as the 3D geometry encoder. 
We recommend adopting the 7B model as the backbone, as our experiments show it delivers both superior performance and faster inference speed.

}
```

### 4. Configure Data Paths

Next, you need to configure the data paths in the source code. Modify the `src/qwen_vl/data/__init__.py` file to ensure the script can locate your datasets.

  * `annotation_path`: This should point to the JSON or JSONL file containing your downloaded dataset annotations.
  * `data_path`: This can be left empty if the image and video paths specified in your annotation files are absolute paths. Otherwise, provide the directory where your data is stored.

## Training

We train two models separately for 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning tasks. The following instructions are for 3D scene understanidng.

For spatial reasoning, run the following command:

```bash
# Qwen2.5VL backbone
bash scripts/train/train_sr_qwen25vl.sh

# Qwen3VL backbone
bash scripts/train/train_sr_qwen3vl.sh
```

#### Training Details
  * **Backbones**: Our models are built upon two sizes of Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL, and integrated with VGGT-1B as the 3D geometry encoder.
  * **Hardware:** Our experiments were conducted on a setup with **8x NVIDIA H800 (80G)** GPUs.
  * **Hyperparameters:** We trained the model for one epoch using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 64, a warmup ratio of 0.03, and a learning rate of 1e-5.
  * **Frozen Components:** During training, the visual encoder of the MLLM, the 3D geometry encoder, and the multimodal connector are kept frozen.
  * **Training Duration:**
      * Vanilla Regime: Approximately 9 hours for 8B model.
      * Scaled Regime: Approximately a week for 8B model.

#### Training Notes & Precautions
  * **Transformer version**: There is a version mismatch between the requirements for Qwen3-VL and Qwen2.5-VL backbones:
      * Qwen3-VL: Training the Qwen3-VL backbone requires a more recent version of the transformers. We recommend using transformers==4.57.0.
      * Qwen2.5-VL: This backbone is incompatible with the version required for Qwen3-VL. For training Qwen2.5-VL, please use transformers==4.50.0.
      * Evaluation: For the sake of consistency during inference and benchmarking, transformers==4.57.0 can be used for both models.
  * **Video Data Processing**: In our implementation, we observed that directly loading and decoding video files during training can lead to inefficient memory management and potential overhead. To optimize throughput and stability, we recommend pre-sampling videos into images uniformly prior to training.
  * **Flash Attention in SGF**: We have integrated a Flash Attention implementation for the Spatial-Grounded Fusion (SGF) module. Please note that while Flash Attention accelerates training, we have observed a performance discrepancy between the Flash Attention implementation and the default attention mechanism in certain scenarios.

<!-- The training scripts will be released soon. -->
## Evaluation

Evaluation is performed using the [LMMs-Eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval) with greedy sampling for generation. For video benchmarks, 32 frames are uniformly sampled for VSI-Bench.

Please refer to the example evaluation script (`scripts/evaluation/eval.sh`) below for detailed command usage. You may need to adjust `model_path`, `benchmark`, or other parameters based on your specific setup and requirements.
```bash
set -e
export LMMS_EVAL_LAUNCHER="accelerate"
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
export NCCL_NVLS_ENABLE=0
benchmark=vsibench # choices: [vsibench, cvbench, blink_spatial]
output_path=logs/$(TZ="Asia/Shanghai" date "+%Y%m%d")
model_path=QeoThinker-VGGT-Qwen3VL-8B-Scaled

accelerate launch --num_processes=8 -m lmms_eval \
    --model geothinker \
    --model_args pretrained=$model_path,use_flash_attention_2=true,max_num_frames=32,max_length=12800,max_pixels=451584,min_pixels=12544 \
